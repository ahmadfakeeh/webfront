                <h3 style="background-color: #DB3256;">Images</h3>
                <p> Besides showing you how to display images in HTML, I explain some common gotchas like why forgetting to set the width and height of the image can cause you trouble. I will also show you a couple of techniques you can use with Chrome Developer Tools. First, we test the page with simulated slower Internet connection. Then, I'll show you how to test what your page looks like when the server hosting your images is down.</p>

                <p> Links are pretty much what makes the web what it is: one thing connected to another. Specifically, in the case of HTML, one piece of content connected to another piece of content. In this article, I am going to go over different types of links and how you can create them in your HTML page.</p>

                <p> There are many applications for HTML character entity references. In this article, besides explaining what HTML character entity references are, I will concentrate on the most common problems they solve. We'll look at a bunch of code examples, including one gotcha in the Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
